<p id="id00001" style="margin-top: 3em">In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:</p>

<p id="id00002">  Barnardo. Who's there?<br>

  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand &amp; vnfold<br>

your selfe<br>
</p>

<p id="id00003">   Bar. Long liue the King</p>

<p id="id00004">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p id="id00005">As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .</p>

<p id="id00006">The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.</p>

<p id="id00007">You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.</p>

<p id="id00008">So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors. . . .</p>

<p id="id00009">So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's play.</p>

<p id="id00010">Michael S. Hart<br>

<p id="id00011">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p id="id00012">Scanner's Notes:</p>

<p id="id00013">What this is and isn't. This was taken from a copy of<br>

Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can come in<br>

ASCII to the printed text.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00014">The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae. I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the printed
text. I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of
the Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them. Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added. So if you don't like that you
can delete everything within the brackets if you want a purer
Shakespeare.</p>

<p id="id00015">Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are
textual differences between various copies of the first folio. So
there may be differences (other than what I have mentioned above)
between this and other first folio editions. This is due to the
printer's habit of setting the type and running off a number of
copies and then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type
and then continuing the printing run. The proof run wasn't thrown
away but incorporated into the printed copies. This is just the
way it is. The text I have used was a composite of more than 30
different First Folio editions' best pages.</p>

<p id="id00021">  Rodorigo. Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly<br>

As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this<br>

I know my price, I am worth no worsse a place.<br>

But he (as louing his owne pride, and purposes)<br>

Euades them, with a bumbast Circumstance,<br>

Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre,<br>

Non-suites my Mediators. For certes, saies he,<br>

I haue already chose my Officer. And what was he?<br>

For-sooth, a great Arithmatician,<br>

One Michaell Cassio, a Florentine,<br>

(A Fellow almost damn'd in a faire Wife)<br>

That neuer set a Squadron in the Field,<br>

Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes<br>

More then a Spinster. Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke:<br>

Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose<br>

As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise)<br>

Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election;<br>

At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds<br>

Christen'd, and Heathen) must be be-leed, and calm'd<br>

'Tis the cursse of Seruice;<br>

Preferment goes by Letter, and affection,<br>

And not by old gradation, where each second<br>

Stood Heire to'th' first. Now Sir, be iudge your selfe,<br>

I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him.<br>

We cannot all be Masters, nor all Masters<br>

Cannot be truely follow'd. You shall marke<br>

Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue;<br>

That (doting on his owne obsequious bondage)<br>

Weares out his time, much like his Masters Asse,<br>

For naught but Prouender, &amp; when he's old Casheer'd.<br>

Whip me such honest knaues. Others there are<br>

Who trym'd in Formes, and visages of Dutie,<br>

Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues,<br>

And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords<br>

Doe well thriue by them.<br>

And when they haue lin'd their Coates<br>

Doe themselues Homage.<br>

These Fellowes haue some soule,<br>

And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir)<br>

It is as sure as you are Rodorigo,<br>

Were I the Moore, I would not be Iago:<br>

In following him, I follow but my selfe.<br>

Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie,<br>

But seeming so, for my peculiar end:<br>

For when my outward Action doth demonstrate<br>

The natiue act, and figure of my heart<br>

In Complement externe, 'tis not long after<br>

Proclaime him in the Streets. Incense her kinsmen,<br>

And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell,<br>

Plague him with Flies: though that his Ioy be Ioy,<br>

(As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter,<br>

At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night<br>

Transported with no worse nor better guard,<br>

But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier,<br>

To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore:<br>

If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance,<br>

We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs.<br>

But if you know not this, my Manners tell me,<br>

We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue<br>

That from the sence of all Ciuilitie,<br>

I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.<br>

Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue)<br>

I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,<br>

Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes<br>

In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,<br>

Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe.<br>

If she be in her Chamber, or your house,<br>

Light, I say, light.<br>

Enter.<br>

It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place<br>

To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,)<br>

Against the Moore. For I do know the State,<br>

(How euer this may gall him with some checke)<br>

Cannot with safetie cast-him. For he's embark'd<br>

With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres,<br>

(Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules<br>

Another of his Fadome, they haue none,<br>

To lead their Businesse. In which regard,<br>

Though I do hate him as I do hell paines,<br>

Yet, for necessitie of present life,<br>

I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,<br>

(Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him<br>

To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,<br>

That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,<br>

Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br>

But not instinctiuely: I did consent,<br>

I saw Othello's visage in his mind,<br>

And to his Honours and his valiant parts,<br>

Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.<br>

So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind<br>

A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,<br>

But to be free, and bounteous to her minde:<br>

And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke<br>

And bring them after in the best aduantage.<br>

Come Desdemona, I haue but an houre<br>

Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction<br>

To spend with thee. We must obey the time.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00143">  Rod. Iago</p>

<p id="id00144">   Iago. What saist thou Noble heart?<br>

  Rod. What will I do, think'st thou?<br>

  Iago. Why go to bed and sleepe<br>
</p>

<p id="id00145">   Rod. I will incontinently drowne my selfe</p>

<p id="id00146">   Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why
thou silly Gentleman?
  Rod. It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:
and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is
our Physition</p>

<p id="id00147">   Iago. Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world
for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish
betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that
knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would
drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would
change my Humanity with a Baboone</p>

<p id="id00148" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Rod. What should I do? I confesse it is my shame
to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it</p>

<p id="id00149">   Iago. Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are
thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,
our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels,
or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:
Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with
many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured
with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie
of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues
had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie,
the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would
conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we
haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall
Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you
call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen</p>

<p id="id00150">   Rod. It cannot be</p>

<p id="id00151">   Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission
of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown
Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,
and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of
perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee
then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the
Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say
put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona
should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in
thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement
in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration,
put but Money in thy purse. These Moores
are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.
The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,
shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She
must change for youth: when she is sated with his body
she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money
in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do
it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money
thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt
an erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be
not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou
shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning
thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather
to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be
drown'd, and go without her</p>

<p id="id00152">   Rodo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
the issue?
  Iago. Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue
told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I
hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse
reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against
him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a
pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the
Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,
prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow.
Adieu</p>

For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane<br>

If I would time expend with such Snipe,<br>

But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,<br>

And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets<br>

She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,<br>

But I, for meere suspition in that kinde,<br>

Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,<br>

The better shall my purpose worke on him:<br>

Cassio's a proper man: Let me see now,<br>

To get his Place, and to plume vp my will<br>

In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.<br>

After some time, to abuse Othello's eares,<br>

That he is too familiar with his wife:<br>

He hath a person, and a smooth dispose<br>

To be suspected: fram'd to make women false.<br>

The Moore is of a free, and open Nature,<br>

That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,<br>

Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?<br>

  2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:<br>

For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,<br>

The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,<br>

The winde-shak'd-Surge, with high &amp; monstrous Maine<br>

</p>

<p id="id00162">  3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done:<br>

The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,<br>

That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,<br>

On most part of their Fleet<br>

Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:<br>

Come, how would'st thou praise me?<br>

  Iago. I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes<br>

from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes<br>

With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great

If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie,
it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers
so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play

The Turkes are drown'd.<br>

How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?<br>

(Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,<br>

I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,<br>

I prattle out of fashion, and I doate<br>

In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,<br>

Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:<br>

Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell,<br>

He is a good one, and his worthynesse<br>

Do's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,<br>

Once more well met at Cyprus.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00216">Exit Othello and Desdemona.</p>

<p id="id00217">  Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.
Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men
being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,
more then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to
night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell
thee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him</p>

<p id="id00218">   Rod. With him? Why, 'tis not possible</p>

<p id="id00219">   Iago. Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed.
Marke me with what violence she first lou'd
the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall
lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet
heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight
shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood
is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a
game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.
Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,
and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now
for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate
tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the,
gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil
instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.
Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd
position) who stands so eminent in the degree of
this Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no
further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme
of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse
of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,
why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion:
that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages,
though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.
A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:
and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene
mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the
woman hath found him already</p>

<p id="id00220" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Rodo. I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most
bless'd condition</p>

<p id="id00221">   Iago. Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is
made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would
neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not
marke that?
  Rod. Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie</p>

<p id="id00222">   Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure
prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.
They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes
embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when
these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand
comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate
conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue
brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for
the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you
not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion
to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or
tainting his discipline, or from what other course
you please, which the time shall more fauorably minister</p>

<p id="id00223">   Rod. Well</p>

<p id="id00224">   Iago. Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and
happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for
euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.
Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe,
but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you
haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I
shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment
most profitably remoued, without the which there were
no expectation of our prosperitie</p>

<p id="id00225">   Rodo. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity</p>

Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,<br>

And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona<br>

For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,<br>

Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br>

Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe<br>

(For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too)<br>

Make the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,<br>

For making him egregiously an Asse,<br>

Out-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather<br>

For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,<br>

lost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of
myselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation,
Iago, my Reputation</p>

<p id="id00299">   Iago. As I am an honest man I had thought you had
receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that
then in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false
imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing.
You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you
repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are
more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are
but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie,
then in malice) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse
dogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to
him againe, and he's yours</p>

<p id="id00300">   Cas. I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue
so good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so
indiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And
squabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian
with ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of
Wine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call
thee Diuell</p>

<p id="id00301">   Iago. What was he that you follow'd with your<br>

Sword? What had he done to you?<br>

  Cas. I know not<br>
</p>

<p id="id00302">   Iago. Is't possible?
  Cas. I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly:
a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that
men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away
their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,
reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts</p>

<p id="id00303">   Iago. Why? But you are now well enough: how
came you thus recouered?
  Cas. It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue
place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me
another to make me frankly despise my selfe</p>

<p id="id00304">   Iago. Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the<br>

Time, the Place, &amp; the Condition of this Country stands<br>

I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as<br>

it is, mend it for your owne good<br>
</p>

<p id="id00305">   Cas. I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell
me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra,
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible
man, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh
strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient
is a diuell</p>

<p id="id00306">   Iago. Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar<br>

Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.<br>

And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue<br>

you<br>
</p>

<p id="id00307">   Cassio. I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?
  Iago. You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a
time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's
Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,
for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the
Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts
and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune
her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is
of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more
then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene
you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my
Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of
your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before</p>

<p id="id00308">   Cassio. You aduise me well</p>

<p id="id00309" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Iago. I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest
kindnesse</p>

<p id="id00310">   Cassio. I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning,
I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake
for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me</p>

<p id="id00311" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Iago. You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I

<p id="id00313">Exit Cassio.</p>

<p id="id00314">  Iago. And what's he then,<br>

That saies I play the Villaine?<br>

When this aduise is free I giue, and honest,<br>

Proball to thinking, and indeed the course<br>

To win the Moore againe.<br>

For 'tis most easie<br>

Th' inclyning Desdemona to subdue<br>

In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull<br>

As the free Elements. And then for her<br>

To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,<br>

All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:<br>

His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,<br>

That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,<br>

Euen as her Appetite shall play the God,<br>

With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,<br>

To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course,<br>

Directly to his good? Diuinitie of hell,<br>

When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,<br>

They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,<br>

As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole<br>

Plies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune,<br>

And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,<br>

Ile powre this pestilence into his eare:<br>

That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,<br>

And by how much she striues to do him good,<br>

She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.<br>

So will I turne her vertue into pitch.<br>

And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,<br>

That shall en-mash them all.<br>

How now Rodorigo?<br>

Enter Rodorigo.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00315">  Rodorigo. I do follow heere in the Chace, not
like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the
Crie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night
exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue
will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;
And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne
againe to Venice</p>

<p id="id00316">   Iago. How poore are they that haue not Patience?<br>

What wound did euer heale but by degrees?<br>

Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft<br>

And Wit depends on dilatory time:<br>

Dos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,<br>

And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:<br>

Though other things grow faire against the Sun,<br>

Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:<br>

Content thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning;<br>

Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.<br>

Retire thee, go where thou art Billited:<br>

Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:<br>

And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,<br>

As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine<br>

And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,<br>

And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,<br>

Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:<br>

For such things in a false disloyall Knaue<br>

That Passion cannot rule<br>

</p>

<p id="id00398">   Oth. What dost thou meane?<br>

  Iago. Good name in Man, &amp; woman (deere my Lord)<br>

Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;<br>

Who steales my purse, steales trash:<br>

'Tis something, nothing;<br>

'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:<br>

But he that filches from me my good Name,<br>

Robs me of that, which not enriches him,<br>

And makes me poore indeed<br>
</p>

<p id="id00399">   Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts</p>

<p id="id00400">   Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,<br>

Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00401">   Oth. Ha?<br>

  Iago. Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,<br>

It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke<br>

The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,<br>

Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:<br>

But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,<br>

Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?<br>

  Oth. O miserie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00402">   Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,<br>

But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,<br>

To him that euer feares he shall be poore:<br>

Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend<br>

From Iealousie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00403">   Oth. Why? why is this?<br>

Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;<br>

To follow still the changes of the Moone<br>

With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,<br>

Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,<br>

When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule<br>

To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,<br>

Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,<br>

To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,<br>

Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:<br>

Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous.<br>

Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw<br>

The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,<br>

For she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago,<br>

Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;<br>

And on the proofe, there is no more but this,<br>

Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie<br>
</p>

<p id="id00404">   Ia. I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason<br>

To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you<br>

With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)<br>

Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:<br>

Looke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio,<br>

Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:<br>

I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,<br>

Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:<br>

I know our Country disposition well:<br>

In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes<br>

They dare not shew their Husbands.<br>

Their best Conscience,<br>

Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne<br>
</p>

<p id="id00405">   Oth. Dost thou say so?<br>

  Iago. She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,<br>

And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,<br>

She lou'd them most<br>
</p>

<p id="id00406">   Oth. And so she did</p>

<p id="id00407">   Iago. Why go too then:<br>

Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming<br>

To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,<br>

He thought 'twas Witchcraft.<br>

But I am much too blame:<br>

I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br>

For too much louing you<br>
</p>

<p id="id00408">   Oth. I am bound to thee for euer</p>

<p id="id00409">   Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:<br>

  Oth. Not a iot, not a iot<br>
</p>

<p id="id00410">   Iago. Trust me, I feare it has:<br>

I hope you will consider what is spoke<br>

Comes from your Loue.<br>

But I do see y'are moou'd:<br>

I am to pray you, not to straine my speech<br>

To grosser issues, nor to larger reach,<br>

Then to Suspition<br>
</p>

<p id="id00411">   Oth. I will not</p>

<p id="id00412">   Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)<br>

My speech should fall into such vilde successe,<br>

Which my Thoughts aym'd not.<br>

Cassio's my worthy Friend:<br>

My Lord, I see y'are mou'd<br>
</p>

<p id="id00413">   Oth. No, not much mou'd:<br>

I do not thinke but Desdemona's honest<br>
</p>

<p id="id00414">   Iago. Long liue she so;<br>

And long liue you to thinke so<br>
</p>

<p id="id00415">   Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe</p>

<p id="id00416">   Iago. I, there's the point:<br>

As (to be bold with you)<br>

Not to affect many proposed Matches<br>

Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,<br>

Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends:<br>

Foh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke,<br>

Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.<br>

But (pardon me) I do not in position<br>

Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare<br>

Her will, recoyling to her better iudgement,<br>

May fal to match you with her Country formes,<br>

And happily repent<br>
</p>

<p id="id00417">   Oth. Farewell, farewell:<br>

If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:<br>

Set on thy wife to obserue.<br>

Leaue me Iago<br>
</p>

<p id="id00418">   Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue</p>

<p id="id00419">   Othel. Why did I marry?<br>

This honest Creature (doubtlesse)<br>

Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds<br>
</p>

<p id="id00420">   Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor<br>

To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,<br>

Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;<br>

For sure he filles it vp with great Ability;<br>

Yet if you please, to him off a-while:<br>

You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:<br>

Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment<br>

With any strong, or vehement importunitie,<br>

Much will be seene in that: In the meane time,<br>

Let me be thought too busie in my feares,<br>

(As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)<br>

And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor<br>
</p>

<p id="id00421">   Oth. Feare not my gouernment</p>

<p id="id00422">   Iago. I once more take my leaue.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00423">  Oth. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,<br>

And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit<br>

Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,<br>

Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings,<br>

I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde<br>

To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,<br>

And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation<br>

That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd<br>

Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)<br>

Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe<br>

Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!<br>

That we can call these delicate Creatures ours,<br>

And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,<br>

And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,<br>

Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue<br>

For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,<br>

Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,<br>

'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:<br>

Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,<br>

Your dinner, and the generous Islanders<br>

By you inuited, do attend your presence<br>
</p>

<p id="id00426">   Oth. I am too blame</p>

<p id="id00427">   Des. Why do you speake so faintly?<br>

Are you not well?<br>

  Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere<br>
</p>

<p id="id00428">   Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.<br>

Let me but binde it hard, within this houre<br>

It will be well<br>
</p>

<p id="id00429">   Oth. Your Napkin is too little:<br>

Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.<br>

Enter.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00430">  Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.<br>

Aemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:<br>

This was her first remembrance from the Moore,<br>

My wayward Husband hath a hundred times<br>

Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,<br>

(For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)<br>

That she reserues it euermore about her,<br>

To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,<br>

And giu't Iago: what he will do with it<br>

Heauen knowes, not I:<br>

I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.<br>

Enter Iago.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00431">  Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?<br>

Aemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you<br>
</p>

<p id="id00432">   Iago. You haue a thing for me?<br>

It is a common thing-<br>

Aemil. Hah?<br>

  Iago. To haue a foolish wife.<br>

Aemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now<br>

For that same Handkerchiefe<br>
</p>

<p id="id00433">   Iago. What Handkerchiefe?<br>

Aemil. What Handkerchiefe?<br>

Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona,<br>

That which so often you did bid me steale<br>
</p>

<p id="id00434">   Iago. Hast stolne it from her?<br>

Aemil. No: but she let it drop by negligence,<br>

And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:<br>

Looke, heere 'tis<br>
</p>

<p id="id00435">   Iago. A good wench, giue it me.<br>

Aemil. What will you do with't, that you haue bene<br>

so earnest to haue me filch it?<br>

  Iago. Why, what is that to you?<br>

Aemil. If it be not for some purpose of import,<br>

Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad<br>

When she shall lacke it<br>

<p id="id00436">   Iago. Be not acknowne on't:<br>

I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.<br>

<p id="id00437">Exit aemil.</p>

<p id="id00438">I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,<br>

And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,<br>

Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,<br>

As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.<br>

The Moore already changes with my poyson:<br>

Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,<br>

Which at the first are scarse found to distaste:<br>

But with a little acte vpon the blood,<br>

Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.<br>

Enter Othello.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00439">Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,<br>

Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world<br>

</p>

<p id="id00440">   Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?<br>

  Iago. Why how now Generall? No more of that<br>
</p>

<p id="id00441">   Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:<br>

I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,<br>

Then but to know't a little<br>
</p>

<p id="id00442">   Iago. How now, my Lord?<br>

  Oth. What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?<br>

I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:<br>

I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.<br>

I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:<br>

He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,<br>

Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all<br>
</p>

<p id="id00443">   Iago. I am sorry to heare this?<br>

  Oth. I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,<br>

Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,<br>

So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer<br>

Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;<br>

Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,<br>

That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,<br>

Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,<br>

The Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife,<br>

The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,<br>

Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:<br>

And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates<br>

Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,<br>

Farewell: Othello's Occupation's gone<br>
</p>

<p id="id00444">   Iago. Is't possible my Lord?<br>

  Oth. Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;<br>

Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,<br>

Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule,<br>

Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog<br>

Then answer my wak'd wrath<br>
</p>

<p id="id00445">   Iago. Is't come to this?<br>

  Oth. Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,<br>

That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,<br>

To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life<br>
</p>

<p id="id00446">   Iago. My Noble Lord</p>

<p id="id00447">   Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,<br>

Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse<br>

On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:<br>

Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;<br>

For nothing canst thou to damnation adde,<br>

Greater then that<br>

<p id="id00448">   Iago. O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!<br>

Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?<br>

God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,<br>

That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!<br>

Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)<br>

To be direct and honest, is not safe.<br>

I thanke you for this profit, and from hence<br>

Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence<br>
</p>

<p id="id00449">   Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest</p>

<p id="id00450">   Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,<br>

And looses that it workes for<br>
</p>

<p id="id00451">   Oth. By the World,<br>

I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:<br>

I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:<br>

Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh<br>

As Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke<br>

As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,<br>

Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,<br>

Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied<br>
</p>

<p id="id00452">   Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:<br>

I do repent me, that I put it to you.<br>

You would be satisfied?<br>

  Oth. Would? Nay, and I will<br>
</p>

<p id="id00453">   Iago. And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?<br>

Would you the super-vision grossely gape on?<br>

Behold her top'd?<br>

  Oth. Death, and damnation. Oh!<br>

  Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,<br>

To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,<br>

If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster<br>

More then their owne. What then? How then?<br>

What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?<br>

It is impossible you should see this,<br>

Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,<br>

As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse<br>

As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,<br>

If imputation, and strong circumstances,<br>

Which leade directly to the doore of Truth,<br>

Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't<br>
</p>

<p id="id00454">   Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall</p>

<p id="id00455">   Iago. I do not like the Office.<br>

But sith I am entred in this cause so farre<br>

(Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)<br>

I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,<br>

And being troubled with a raging tooth,<br>

I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,<br>

So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter<br>

Their Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio:<br>

In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,<br>

Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,<br>

And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:<br>

Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,<br>

As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,<br>

That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,<br>

And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,<br>

That gaue thee to the Moore<br>
</p>

<p id="id00456">   Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!<br>

  Iago. Nay, this was but his Dreame<br>
</p>

<p id="id00457">   Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,<br>

'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame<br>
</p>

<p id="id00458">   Iago. And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,<br>

That do demonstrate thinly<br>

<p id="id00459">   Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces</p>

<p id="id00460">   Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,<br>

She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,<br>

Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe<br>

Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?<br>

  Oth. I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift<br>
</p>

<p id="id00461">   Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe<br>

(I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day<br>

See Cassio wipe his Beard with<br>

<p id="id00462">   Oth. If it be that</p>

<p id="id00463">   Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.<br>

It speakes against her with the other proofes<br>

<p id="id00464">   Othel. O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:<br>

One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.<br>

Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago,<br>

All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.<br>

Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,<br>

Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne<br>

<p id="id00470">   Oth. I greet thy loue,<br>

Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,<br>

a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were<br>

to lye in mine owne throat<br>
</p>

<p id="id00481">   Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?<br>

  Clo. I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make<br>

Questions, and by them answer<br>
</p>

<p id="id00482">   Des. Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I
haue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will
be well</p>

Aemil. I know not Madam<br>

<p id="id00486">   Des. Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse<br>

Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore<br>

Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,<br>

As iealious Creatures are, it were enough<br>

To put him to ill-thinking.<br>

Aemil. Is he not iealious?<br>

  Des. Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,<br>

Drew all such humors from him.<br>

Aemil. Looke where he comes.<br>

Enter Othello.<br>

<p id="id00487">  Des. I will not leaue him now, till Cassio be<br>

Call'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord?<br>

  Oth. Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble!<br>

How do you, Desdemona?<br>

  Des. Well, my good Lord<br>
</p>

<p id="id00488">   Oth. Giue me your hand.<br>

This hand is moist, my Lady<br>

<p id="id00489">   Des. It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow</p>

<p id="id00490">   Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:<br>

Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires<br>

A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,<br>

Much Castigation, Exercise deuout,<br>

For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere<br>

That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,<br>

A franke one<br>
</p>

<p id="id00491">   Des. You may (indeed) say so:<br>

For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart<br>
</p>

<p id="id00492">   Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:<br>

But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts<br>

<p id="id00493">   Des. I cannot speake of this:<br>

Come, now your promise<br>
</p>

<p id="id00494">   Oth. What promise, Chucke?<br>

  Des. I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you<br>
</p>

<p id="id00495">   Oth. I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:<br>

  Des. No indeed, my Lord<br>
</p>

<p id="id00500">   Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe<br>

Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue:<br>

She was a Charmer, and could almost read<br>

The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,<br>

'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father<br>

Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,<br>

Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye<br>

Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt<br>

After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,<br>

And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)<br>

To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,<br>

Make it a Darling, like your precious eye:<br>

To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,<br>

As nothing else could match<br>

  Oth. 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:<br>

A Sybill that had numbred in the world<br>

The Sun to course, two hundred compasses,<br>

In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:<br>

The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,<br>

And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull<br>

Conseru'd of Maidens hearts<br>

  Oth. Ha? wherefore?<br>

  Des. Why do you speake so startingly, and rash?<br>

  Oth. Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way?<br>

  Des. Blesse vs<br>
</p>

<p id="id00504">   Oth. Say you?<br>

This is a tricke to put me from my suite,<br>

  Des. I neu'r saw this before.<br>

Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,<br>

I am most vnhappy in the losse of it.<br>

Aemil. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:<br>

They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,<br>

They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full<br>

<p id="id00518">   Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with<br>

you?<br>

  Cassio. Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,<br>

That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe<br>

Exist, and be a member of his loue,<br>

Whom I, with all the Office of my heart<br>

Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.<br>

If my offence, be of such mortall kinde,<br>

That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,<br>

Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,<br>

Can ransome me into his loue againe,<br>

But to know so, must be my benefit:<br>

So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,<br>

And shut my selfe vp in some other course<br>

To Fortunes Almes<br>
</p>

<p id="id00519">   Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)<br>

My Aduocation is not now in Tune;<br>

My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,<br>

Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.<br>

So helpe me euery spirit sanctified,<br>

As I haue spoken for you all my best,<br>

And stood within the blanke of his displeasure<br>

For my free speech. You must awhile be patient:<br>

What I can do, I will: and more I will<br>

Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you<br>
</p>

<p id="id00520">   Iago. Is my Lord angry?<br>

Aemil. He went hence but now:<br>

And certainly in strange vnquietnesse<br>

<p id="id00521">   Iago. Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon<br>

When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,<br>

And like the Diuell from his very Arme<br>

Something of moment then: I will go meet him,<br>

There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00522">Exit</p>

<p id="id00523">  Des. I prythee do so. Something sure of State,<br>

Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise<br>

Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,<br>

Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,<br>

Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,<br>

Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.<br>

For let our finger ake, and it endues<br>

Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense<br>

Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,<br>

Nor of them looke for such obseruancie<br>

</p>

<p id="id00533">   Cassio. Go too, woman:<br>

Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,<br>

No, in good troth Bianca<br>

I found it in my Chamber,<br>

I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded<br>

(As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:<br>

Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time<br>

An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?<br>

  Oth. Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme?<br>

It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:<br>

They that meane vertuously, and yet do so,<br>

The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen<br>

<p id="id00545">   Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:<br>

May she giue that?<br>

and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not
inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some
Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)

Enter Cassio.<br>

<p id="id00555">How now Cassio?<br>

Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,<br>

And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,<br>

Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,<br>

The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,<br>

And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes<br>

But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?<br>

Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br>

A Huswife that by selling her desires<br>

Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature<br>

That dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague<br>

To be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)<br>

He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine<br>

From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.<br>

Enter Cassio.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00565">As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:<br>

And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue<br>

To tell it o're: go too, well said, well said<br>

</p>

<p id="id00580">   Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story</p>

<p id="id00581">   Cassio. She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery
place. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke
with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the
Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck</p>

<p id="id00582">   Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports<br>

it<br>
</p>

<p id="id00583">   Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:<br>

So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha<br>
</p>

<p id="id00584">   Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:
oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I
shall throw it to</p>

<p id="id00585">   Cassio. Well, I must leaue her companie</p>

<p id="id00586">   Iago. Before me: looke where she comes.<br>

Enter Bianca.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00587">  Cas. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?
What do you meane by this haunting of me?
  Bian. Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what
did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue
me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take
out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should
finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.
This is some Minxes token, &amp; I must take out the worke?
There, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had
it, Ile take out no worke on't</p>

<p id="id00588">   Cassio. How now, my sweete Bianca?<br>

How now? How now?<br>

  Othe. By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe<br>
</p>

<p id="id00589">   Bian. If you'le come to supper to night you may, if<br>

you will not come when you are next prepar'd for.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00590">Exit</p>

<p id="id00591">  Iago. After her: after her</p>

<p id="id00592">   Cas. I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else</p>

<p id="id00593">   Iago. Will you sup there?<br>

  Cassio. Yes, I intend so<br>
</p>

<p id="id00594">   Iago. Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very<br>

faine speake with you<br>
</p>

<p id="id00595">   Cas. Prythee come: will you?<br>

  Iago. Go too; say no more<br>
</p>

<p id="id00596">   Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago</p>

<p id="id00597">   Iago. Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?<br>

  Oth. Oh, Iago<br>
</p>

<p id="id00598">   Iago. And did you see the Handkerchiefe?<br>

  Oth. Was that mine?<br>

  Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes<br>

the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he<br>

hath giu'n it his whore<br>
</p>

<p id="id00599">   Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:<br>

A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?<br>

  Iago. Nay, you must forget that<br>
</p>

<p id="id00600">   Othello. I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to
night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to
stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world
hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours
side, and command him Taskes</p>

<p id="id00601">   Iago. Nay, that's not your way</p>

<p id="id00602">   Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate
with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will
sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous
wit, and inuention?
  Iago. She's the worse for all this</p>

<p id="id00603">   Othe. Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:<br>

And then of so gentle a condition?<br>

  Iago. I too gentle<br>
</p>

<p id="id00604">   Othe. Nay that's certaine:<br>

But yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it<br>

Iago<br>
</p>

<p id="id00605">   Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her
pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere
no body</p>

<p id="id00606">   Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?<br>

  Iago. Oh, 'tis foule in her<br>
</p>

<p id="id00607">   Oth. With mine Officer?<br>

  Iago. That's fouler<br>
</p>

<p id="id00608">   Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not
expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide
my mind againe: this night Iago</p>

<p id="id00609">   Iago. Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,<br>

Euen the bed she hath contaminated<br>

<p id="id00610">   Oth. Good, good:<br>

The Iustice of it pleases: very good<br>

You shall heare more by midnight.<br>

Enter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants.<br>

'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke.<br>

See, your wife's with him<br>

An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well<br>

  Lod. He did not call: he's busie in the paper,<br>

Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?<br>

  Des. A most vnhappy one: I would do much<br>

T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio<br>

And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.<br>

And she's obedient: as you say obedient.<br>

Very obedient: proceed you in your teares.<br>

<p id="id00692">Enter Rodorigo.</p>

<p id="id00693">How now Rodorigo?<br>

  Rod. I do not finde<br>

That thou deal'st iustly with me<br>
</p>

<p id="id00694">   Iago. What in the contrarie?
  Rodori. Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise
Iago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from
me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage
of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor
am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I
haue foolishly suffred</p>

<p id="id00695">   Iago. Will you heare me Rodorigo?<br>

  Rodori. I haue heard too much: and your words and<br>

Performances are no kin together<br>
</p>

<p id="id00696">   Iago. You charge me most vniustly</p>

<p id="id00697">   Rodo. With naught but truth: I haue wasted my
selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from
me to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a
Votarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,
and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine
respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none</p>

<p id="id00698">   Iago. Well, go too: very well</p>

<p id="id00699">   Rod. Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor
'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to
finde my selfe fopt in it</p>

<p id="id00700">   Iago. Very well</p>

<p id="id00701">   Rodor. I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my
selfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my
Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull
solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke
satisfaction of you</p>

<p id="id00702">   Iago. You haue said now</p>

<p id="id00703" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Rodo. I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment
of doing</p>

<p id="id00704">   Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and
euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion
then euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception:
but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy
Affaire</p>

<p id="id00705">   Rod. It hath not appeer'd</p>

<p id="id00706">   Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and
your suspition is not without wit and iudgement.
But Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which
I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I
meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night
shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not
Desdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie,
and deuise Engines for my life</p>

<p id="id00707">   Rod. Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse?<br>

  Iago. Sir, there is especiall Commission come from<br>

Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place<br>
</p>

<p id="id00708">   Rod. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona<br>

returne againe to Venice<br>
</p>

<p id="id00709">   Iago. Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh
away with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode
be lingred heere by some accident. Wherein
none can be so determinate, as the remouing of
Cassio</p>

<p id="id00710">   Rod. How do you meane remouing him?<br>

  Iago. Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's<br>

place: knocking out his braines<br>
</p>

<p id="id00711">   Rod. And that you would haue me to do</p>

<p id="id00712">   Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a
right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither
will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable
Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which
I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)
you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere
to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene
vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with
me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that
you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It
is now high supper time: and the night growes to wast.
About it</p>

<p id="id00713">   Rod. I will heare further reason for this</p>

<p id="id00714">   Iago. And you shalbe satisfi'd.</p>

I might doo't as well i'th' darke<br>

<p id="id00739">   Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?<br>

It is a great price, for a small vice<br>
</p>

<p id="id00740">   Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.
Aemil. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when
I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a
ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,
Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for
all the whole world: why, who would not make her husband
a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture
Purgatory for't</p>

<p id="id00741">   Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.

and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in
your owne world, and you might quickly make it right</p>

<p id="id00742">   Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.<br>

Aemil. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as<br>

would store the world they plaid for.<br>

If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,<br>

And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;<br>

Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,<br>

Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,<br>

Or scant our former hauing in despight)<br>

Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,<br>

Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,<br>

Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,<br>

And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,<br>

As Husbands haue. What is it that they do,<br>

When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?<br>

I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?<br>

I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?<br>

It is so too. And haue not we Affections?<br>

Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?<br>

Then let them vse vs well: else let them know,<br>

The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so<br>

Put out the Light, and then put out the Light:<br>

If I quench thee, thou flaming Minister,<br>

When I haue pluck'd thy Rose,<br>

I cannot giue it vitall growth againe,<br>

It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.<br>

Oh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade<br>

Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:<br>

Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,<br>

And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.<br>

So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,<br>

But they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly,<br>

It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes<br>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
